        A character is positioned at bottom of of the canvas. <br />
        Use arrow keys of your computer (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move the character.
        <br />
        <br />
        Move the character to get a star (worth 1 point) and/or a heart(worth 2 points) to gain points. You will win if you gain 10 points.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you get hit by running bugs on street, you will lose 1 point. If your points become 0, game over! You have 3 points at the beginning.
        <br />

        Have fun!
