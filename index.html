        A character is positioned at starting point (bottom of the canvas). Use arrow keys of your computer (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move the character to get several items to gain points.

        <br />
        If you get hit by running bugs on street, you will lose 1 point. You have 3 points at the beginning. If your points become 0, game over!
